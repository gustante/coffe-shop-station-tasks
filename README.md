Description:
A simple but effective web app to manage tasks in different stations of a regular coffee shop.

The app is meant to be used by the whole staff in coffee shop team and monitored by someone with a supervisor or manager role.

As the user logs in, it initiates a session in the back end and redirects them to the Stations page where they can select a different time of the day and see several sections (stations).

Each sections contains several tasks that can be seen by clicking on the dropdown sections. Tasks change according to the time selected.

In an ideal environemnt, each person of the team would be assigned closer to one or more stations. All of them would use the app to check tasks as they complete them throughout the day in their stations. 

Tasks have several information that are stored in a remote database, including a "Checked" status which is updated frequently. When the user checks tasks, it changes its status in the database and sincronizes with all other employees devices. This way, the team can comunicate and work together to make sure everything is covered and well documented.

It is a very useful way to keep track of the daily progress. Especially when shifts are transitioning. When previous workers document it well, new employees starting would know exactly what has been completed and what is still pending.

It is also a good tool for a supervisor to assess stations and monitor the team's progress. They can use this tool to prioritize and modify deployment of the staff according to the business' needs.


In the navbar it leads the management of Stations and Tasks. Currently, there are password-protected options to delete and create new tasks that the supervisor can use to adapt to changes in operations.
